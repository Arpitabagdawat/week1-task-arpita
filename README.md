# Expense Tracker â€“ Week 1 Task

## Submitted by:  
Arpita Bagdawat

## Approach

I created a basic expense tracker using Python.  
The program allows users to enter the amount, category, and date of each expense.  
These entries are stored in a CSV file, and the total expenses are calculated by reading the stored data.

## Assumptions

- The user will enter valid numbers for amounts.
- All data is stored locally in a CSV file.
- The tracker is designed for single-user use, so no login system is included.

## Results

The application runs smoothly and performs the intended functionality:  
- Adds new expenses  
- Saves data accurately  
- Displays total spending
